## Recipes, caveats, gists 🛠

See [trpc-sveltekit](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit) for detailed information related to issues you may encounter when setting up with Prisma, superjson, deploying to Vercel, etc.

## Warning❗❗❗

❌ This example **won't work on Vercel** because it's set up to use a local SQLite database.  
✔️ [trpc-sveltekit](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit), however, **does work on Vercel**.

## Stand with Ukraine

On 24th of February 2022 [Russia unlawfully invaded Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War). This is an unjustified, unprovoked attack on the sovereignty of a neighboring country, but also an open affront to international peace and stability that has the potential to degenerate into a nuclear event threatening the very existence of humanity. I am an EU (Romanian) citizen, but I am doing everything in my power to stop this madness. I stand with Ukraine. The entire Svelte community ❤️🇺🇦. Here's [how you can show your support](https://www.stopputin.net/).
